## Overview
AdFlux Engine is a Advertisement Simulator designed to predict and simulate user behavior (clicks and views) based on historical interaction data. Leveraging cutting-edge architectures like LAVA, Decision Transformers, Gato, and MuZero, AdFlux Engine helps optimize ad placements, enhance user engagement, and maximize conversion rates.

Built with modularity and scalability in mind, AdFlux Engine combines the latest advancements in NLP, reinforcement learning, and sequence modeling, including RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).

## Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Use the latest SOTA models, such as LAVA, Decision Transformer, and Gato, or easily add new architectures.
- **Reinforcement Learning with RLHF**: Train models to align with business goals using offline reinforcement learning.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Accurately predict user behavior using advanced transformer-based models like TimeSformer.
- **Customizable Framework**: Modular structure for easy customization and expansion.
- **Simulations & Analytics**: Run simulations to test ad strategies and analyze results.
